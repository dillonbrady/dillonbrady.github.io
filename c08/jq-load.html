          <p>This November, we will be departing from South Carolina and driving to North Carolina and Virginia for a nine (9) day vacation. We can't wait to load up Dillon's faithful Nissan Sentra with Maggie's many bags of luggage and hit the road.</p>

          <p>We will be celebrating the wedding of Gill Frazier and Ashley Case in Chapel Hill on November 11th. But first, we will be checking out the best breweries, wineries, and BBQ joints the South has to offer.</p>

          <p> Please let us know if you have any recommendations for spots we should check out. We love food and love people who tell us about good food. We may even bring you back a souvenir!</p>
