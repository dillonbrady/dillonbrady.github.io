          <p>Roll up! Roll up! All aboard, for the magical adventure. We will be celebrating the wedding of Gill Frazier and Ashley Case in Chapel Hill on November 11th. But first, we will be checking out the best breweries, vineyards, and BBQ joints NC and VA have to offer. So get ready and come along with us!</p>

          <p>Our new generator is so hefty we have to tow it on a dedicated trailer, but that's worth it because we're powering bigger projects than ever and we expect you to be tinkering throughout the night with our 24-hour maker-jams.</p>

          <p>Our state of the art 3D printer is ready to help you take your own souvenirs home! The only catch is that you have to design them. We'll add each one to our open-source 3D designs library, and the designer of the best one gets to keep the printer.</p>
